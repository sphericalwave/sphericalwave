Hi there! I'm an electrical engineer turned software developer with a passion for writing clean and efficient code. My background in electrical engineering has given me a unique perspective and problem-solving skills that I bring to my software development projects. I have experience in multiple programming languages and a strong interest in learning new technologies. On my GitHub profile, you'll find projects that showcase my skills and demonstrate my ability to create practical and well-designed solutions. Feel free to take a look and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!
